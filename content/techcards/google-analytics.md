Google Analytics is a free solution which tracks your website traffic and gives you information to better understand your users. Once an account is made, Google Analytics gives you a piece of code to run on every page of your website. So every time a user loads your page, information on the user is sent to Google and reported back to you in Google Analytics.

To take it a step further you can:

- Create custom audiences and retargeting in your Google Ads Suite (Search Ads, DV360)
- Set up custom events on your website to track purchases, form submits and button clicks
